# Perception_673
This is a course I took during my second semester of Masters in Robotics at UMD.

All the projects listed here helped me to understand various concepts of Computer Vision such as RANSAC, Detection of AR tags and Virtual Reality (Homography),
Lane Detection in the video (Hough Transforms) and many more.

I'm thankful to my teammates Sukoon Sarin and Mahmoud Dahmani for their collaboration.

You'll find detailed problem statements in each projects with codes, datasets and project report.
It is recommended to try to solve the problems on your own. Only when you find it really difficult to grasp the concept you should take help of these reports and the codes.
